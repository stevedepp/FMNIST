# [FMNIST Colab notebook](https://github.com/stevedepp/FMNIST/blob/master/FMNIST_Depp.ipynb)

A demo of a Colab [notebook's](https://github.com/stevedepp/FMNIST/blob/master/FMNIST_Depp.ipynb) speed and ease of use in building the basics of computer vision classification: 
- [x] retrieving dependencies.  
- [x] retrieving data from Google Drive and loading into Colab environment.  
- [x] exploring data and transforming where necessary.   
- [x] segmenting the data into representative train, validation and test sets. 
- [x] reshaping the sets per model needs.  
- [x] model hyperparameters. 
- [x] running and evaluating DNN and CNN models.  
- [x] employing deconvolutions to review layer activations for tunning model dimensions. 

The colab notebook from this demo video is included in this repo's code library [here](https://github.com/stevedepp/FMNIST/blob/master/FMNIST_Depp.ipynb).
